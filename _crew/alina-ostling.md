Alina has a PhD in Political Sciences from the [European University Institute](http://www.eui.eu) and is presently the co-chair of the Open Knowledge Sweden. She has a long experience as researcher and expert providing support to academic, non-profit and international organisations (European Commission, OSCE/ODIHR, UNDP, UNICEF) in the areas of open government, open data, (digital) media and civic participation.

In her previous, international, projects at the European University Institute, she has carried out data analyses (employing qualitative and quantitative research methods), drafting policy reports and briefs, and communicating results in various public events. At the Centre for Media Pluralism and Media freedom, she was involved in organising events and conducting training sessions, including a yearly Summer School for journalists. Moreover, in an interactive workshop together with media experts, Alina has developed an e-learning course for journalists. She has been working as researcher for the Open Government Partnership, evaluating Sweden’s progress on open data and digitisation between 2013-2019. She recently co-authored a report on open data and political integrity in Sweden, also focusing on procurement data.
